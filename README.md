<p>
	Billy Bob lives in a small village in the forest. Like any other person he turns on the tv and watches the news only to find out that there’s a monster uprising. Billy surely doesn’t wanna get eaten by monsters so he prepared himself for battle and was ready for death as well. 
</p>
<p>
	There are a couple of friends that are willing to help Billy out. You must kill monsters in order to pass to the following wave. As you go through the waves you get more and more help from people and the waves get harder and harder making it difficult to kill the monsters. Your goal is to survive until the final wave and kill the boss.
